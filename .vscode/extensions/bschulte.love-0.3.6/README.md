* Autocomplete for modules, functions, types, and enums
* Signature suggestions for functions of modules and types
* Ctrl+Alt+D tries to open the LOVE 2D documentation for whatever the cursor is currently on
* Alt+L launches LOVE 2D in the current directory

## Requirements

No Requirements

## Extension Settings

No settings - planning on putting in ability to change hotkeys

## Known Issues

* **Versions before 0.3.5 may not have the proper dependencies installed for the extension to work, please update if you have an older version.**
* When a function has multiple signatures, if you select anyone but the 1st and try to type a param it will switch back to the first signature.
* Command to launch love expects "love" to be in the path
